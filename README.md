# Console Finances

## The Task:

*I have been tasked with creating code for analyzing the financial records of a company.

**Instructions:**

* Create a new Github repository and name it `Bootstrap-Portfolio`
* Clone this repository to your computer
* Inside your `Bootstrap-Portfolio` repo, create the folder structure for the webpage.

Folder Structure:

* Create a `index.html`.
* Create a `CSS` folder.
* Inside create a `style.css` file.
* Create an `images` folder and place all images here.

Portfolio site must contain the following:

* A navigation bar
* A navigation menu at the top. Feel free to use Bootstrap's navbar or create your own.
* Include links that are applicable to your portfolio.
* Links should navigate to the appropriate sections
* A hero section
* A jumbotron featuring your picture, your name, and any other information you'd like to include.
* A work section
* A section displaying your work in grid.
* If you need to use placeholder image use placehold.co Links to an external site.
* Use Bootstrap cards for each project.
* The description should give a brief overview of the work.
Each project will eventually link to your class project work!
* A skills section
List out the skills you expect to learn from the bootcamp.
* An about/contact section
* An About Me section in the same row.
* A footer section
* All hyperlinks should have a hover effect.
* All buttons should display a box shadow upon hover.
